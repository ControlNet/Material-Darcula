# Material-Darcula

This Material-Darcula color scheme is modified from the editor scheme extracted from [Material Theme](https://github.com/ChrisRM/material-theme-jetbrains) for Jetbrains IDE. With combining 2 popular features, [Material Design](https://material.io/design/) and out-of-the-box Jetbrains Darcula style, this color scheme performs well in default Darcula UI and provides the material experience.

### Installation

 2. Open IDE, `Settings -> Editor -> Color Scheme`
 3. Click gear icon, then choose `Import Scheme`, and open the file `Material Darcula.icls` downloaded in previous
